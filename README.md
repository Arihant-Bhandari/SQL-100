## The Two Practice Databases

We've set up two realistic databases that mirror what you'd find in actual organizations. Each contains intentionally placed "traps" and data quality issues for you to discover and solve.

Each challenge will ask you to explore, investigate, and solve problems using these databases. You'll develop the instincts of a data detective - skills that transfer to any analytical role.

*Good luck!* 🎯

## What Makes This Challenging?

These databases contain **hidden issues** you'll need to find:

### Data Integrity Puzzles

- ✅ Status flags that contradict reality
- 📊 Values outside expected ranges

### Behavioral & Pattern Analysis
- 🕐 Unusual timing patterns that warrant investigation
- 🔄 Suspicious approval workflows worth examining
- 📈 Anomalous trends hiding in plain sight
